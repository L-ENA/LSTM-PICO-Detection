            "When this project started ( @ ) , the universal view was that the efficacy of ECT was dependent on the generalized seizure , while its cognitive effects were largely determined by electrical dosage .\n",
            "Nonetheless , standard practice involved treating all patients with the same electrical dose , typically at device maximum .\n",
            "Across three studies , we demonstrated marked individual differences in seizure threshold ( ST ) .\n",
            "Many patients were treated orders of magnitude above ST , accounting for much of the adverse cognitive effects of ECT .\n",
            "We also demonstrated that the efficacy of right unilateral ( RUL ) ECT is highly dependent on the degree to which dosage exceeds ST. These findings have been widely replicated .\n",
            "In our most recent study ( started and completed during the MERIT Award period ) , high dosage RUL ECT equaled the efficacy of a robust form of bilateral ( BL ) ECT , and had clinically significant advantages in acute , short-term , and long-term cognitive side effects .\n",
            "These findings have already had impact on practice , and should help resolve the > @ year controversy regarding the relative merits of RUL and BL ECT .\n",
            "The proposed study ( Study @ ) began during the MERIT Award period , and this application requests support for its completion .\n",
            "In addition to replicating the key findings regarding the relative merits of high dosage RUL compared to BL ECT , this study takes a new direction .\n",
            "The traditional ECT stimulus configuration is nonphysiologic .\n",
            "The standard pulse width ( PW ) used in ECT ( @-@ ms ) greatly exceeds the chronaxie for the optimal stimulation necessary for neuronal depoladzation and seizure production ( eg , @-@ ms ) .\n",
            "Excessive PW results in stimulation during refractory periods long following neuronal discharge .\n",
            "By reducing the PW of the ECT stimulus , we should maintain efficacy , but substantially reduce cognitive side effects .\n",
            "Our preliminary data suggest that the magnitude of this effect equals or exceeds the difference in cognitive effects between RUL and BL ECT , and , in fact , the extraordinary difference between sine wave and brief pulse stimulation .\n",
            "This new study uses a randomized , double-masked , parallel group , fully factorial [ RUL vs. BL ECT and ultrabrief PW ( @ ms ) vs. traditional PW ( @ ms ) ] design , with both RUL conditions treated at @ times initial ST and both BL conditions treated at @ times initial ST. We hypothesize that high dose RUL ECT has significant advantages over moderate dose BL ECT [ with both at traditional PW ] .\n",
            "Most critically , use of an ultrabrief PW is equally effective as a long PW , but markedly reduces the short - and long-term cognitive burden of ECT , and is also superior in effects on functional status , subjective cognitive outcome , and neurophysiological alterations .\n",

            "The main hypothesis is that the intervention will lead to improved and sustained engagement in social , employment or education activity and associated health economic benefits .\n",
